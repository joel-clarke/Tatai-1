# Tatai: Learning Application
![alt text](https://github.com/lukethompsxn/TataiProject/blob/master/resources/images/FrontGUIScreen.png "Tatai Front Screen")

Tatai is a joint project university project. This application is targeted to Maori speaking, primary school age children, with the intention of improving the child's mathematical ability through a fun and intuitive learning application.

Tatai provides functionality for the user to play randomly generated questions based on a specific operator, as well as the ability to create their own custom lists. The user is then presented with the question, displayed in numerical representation, and prompted to record their own answer to the question. Voice recognition is carried out on the user's answer and this is used to present the user with the relevent responce.

Unfortunately this cannot be run without the recognition model files, which due to licensing conditions we cannot make public.
